# Comparing Iteration Methods Via Celestial Dynamics
Comparing different numerical iteration techniques by tracing out gravitational dynamics of objects.
Coded entirely in R.

See [THEORY.md](THEORY.md) for complete descriptions of each iteration technique.

See [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md) for results, conclusions and evaluations.

## Overview

**Iteration Techniques Include**:
- Euler method
- Midpoint method
- Heun's method
- Runge-Kutta method

Given an initial set of parameters, these iteration methods can be used to approximate the next coordinates after a short time step.
Repeating this thousands of times, while tracing the coordinates, we illustrate the trajectories/orbits of the projectiles/celestials.
When plotting orbits for every method, eventually the bodies spiral outwards - hence the plots (and ratio of initial to final energies) directly compare the different iteration techniques.

An example for a projectile being fired on Earth's surface is given - with analysis on the accuracies of different iteration methods.
More examples include the Sun and Earth's orbital plot, and similarly a Earth and Moon system plot.

We adapt the two-body system by introducing a third celestial, to illustrate the chaos of the three-body-problem for masses of similar sizes.
