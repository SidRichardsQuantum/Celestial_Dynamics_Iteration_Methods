# Comparing Iteration Methods Via Celestial Dynamics

A numerical simulation suite for comparing different time-stepping methods by tracing gravitational dynamics of celestial bodies.
Implemented entirely in **R** (with some supporting Python).

## Overview

This project explores the accuracy of common numerical iteration techniques, by simulating gravitational systems and observing trajectory divergence over time.

**Iteration Techniques Included**:
- Euler method
- Midpoint method
- Heun's method
- Runge-Kutta (RK4) method

Using an initial set of conditions, each method approximates the position and velocity of bodies over small time steps.
Repeated iterations generate projectile trajectories or orbital paths, which can be compared visually and analytically.
Plots and total energy conservation are used to directly compare the iteration techniques.

**Simulations include:**
- 📍 A projectile launched on Earth's surface
- 🌍 Earth-Sun orbit modeling
- 🌕 Earth-Moon system with inter-body forces
- 🪐 Three-body problems (e.g: figure-8 solution)

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Different numerical integration methods accumulate error differently.
This repository illustrates:
- **How fast energy errors grow** for different methods
- The **visual impact** of method inaccuracy
- Predictions of orbital dynamics
- A glimpse into the complexity of the chaotic three-body problem
- A techniques analytically find solutions to the three-body problem
