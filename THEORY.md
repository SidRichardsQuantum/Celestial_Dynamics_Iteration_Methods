# THEORY

The acceleration of one body is $a = G * m / r^2$, where $G = 6.6743 * 10^{-11} m^3Kg^{-1}s^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant, $m$ is the mass of the other body and $r$ is the distance between them.

## Euler Method

For position $x_0$ and velocity $v_0$, the successive position is written as $x_1 = x_0 + v_0 * dt$, where $dt$ is a small time-increment.
In the code files, $dt$ is written as $h$ which is set to be equal to $(b - a) / N$.
Here, $a$ and $b$ are the initial and final $x$-coordinates, and $N$ is the number of steps between them.

Similarly, the successive velocity $v_1 = v_0 + a_0 * dt$ is also calculated, where $a_0$ is the acceleration at coordinate $(x_0, y_0)$.
Then the acceleration is updated akin to the new position: $a_1 = G * m / r_1^2$.

## Midpoint Method

Similar to the Euler method, but an intermediate $h$-value is also implemented.

## Heun's Method

## Runge-Kutta Method

Four intermediate steps are calculated and their weighted average is used to more-accurately determine the succesive positions and velocities.
